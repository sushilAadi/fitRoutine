# 🛡️ Security Fix Todo List for Fit-App

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** - Must Fix Immediately

---

## **Phase 1: High Priority Security Fixes (1-2 days)**

### **1. Admin Dashboard Security - CRITICAL**
**File**: `/src/app/admin/dashboard/page.jsx`

**Issues**:
- [ ] Direct Firestore operations from client-side
- [ ] Client-side role checking only
- [ ] Admin operations exposed to browser manipulation

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Create `/api/admin/instructors/route.js` - GET all instructors
- [ ] Create `/api/admin/instructors/[id]/approve/route.js` - POST approve instructor
- [ ] Create `/api/admin/instructors/[id]/reject/route.js` - POST reject instructor  
- [ ] Create `/api/admin/instructors/[id]/delete/route.js` - DELETE instructor
- [ ] Add server-side role verification middleware
- [ ] Replace all direct Firestore calls with API calls
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging

**Files to Create**:
```
/src/app/api/admin/
├── middleware.js (auth verification)
├── instructors/
│   ├── route.js (GET all instructors)
│   └── [id]/
│       ├── approve/route.js
│       ├── reject/route.js
│       └── delete/route.js
```

### **2. Enrollment Management Security - CRITICAL**  
**File**: `/src/app/myEnrollment/page.jsx`

**Issues**:
- [ ] Users can manipulate enrollment statuses
- [ ] Business logic handled client-side
- [ ] Direct Firestore updates without validation

**Required Actions**:

- [ ] All mentor personal data exposed to any user
- [ ] No access control on sensitive information

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Create `/api/mentors/route.js` - GET filtered mentor data
- [ ] Create `/api/mentors/[id]/route.js` - GET specific mentor (public info only)
- [ ] Filter sensitive data (phone, email, rates) server-side
- [ ] Add proper data access controls

**Files to Create**:
```
/src/app/api/mentors/
├── route.js (GET filtered mentors)
└── [id]/route.js (GET mentor details)
```

---

### **4. Profile Security - MEDIUM**
**File**: `/src/app/profile/page.jsx`

**Issues**:
- [ ] Users can modify any profile by changing user ID
- [ ] Direct Firestore writes without validation
- [ ] No data integrity checks

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Create `/api/profile/route.js` - GET/PUT user profile
- [ ] Create `/api/profile/weight/route.js` - POST weight records
- [ ] Add user ownership verification
- [ ] Implement data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add profile change audit logging

**Files to Create**:
```
/src/app/api/profile/
├── route.js (GET/PUT profile)
└── weight/route.js (POST weight record)
```

---

### **5. Client Management Security - MEDIUM**
**File**: `/src/app/clients/page.jsx`

**Issues**:
- [ ] Access to other mentors' client data possible
- [ ] Client-side filtering can be bypassed

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Create `/api/clients/route.js` - GET mentor's clients only
- [ ] Add server-side mentor-client relationship verification
- [ ] Implement proper authorization middleware
- [ ] Add access logging for client data

**Files to Create**:
```
/src/app/api/clients/
└── route.js (GET authorized clients only)
```

---

## **Phase 3: Infrastructure & Security Hardening (1 day)**

### **6. Authentication Middleware**
**Priority**: HIGH

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Create `/src/middleware/auth.js` - Verify Clerk tokens
- [ ] Create `/src/middleware/rbac.js` - Role-based access control
- [ ] Add error handling middleware
- [ ] Implement request logging
- [ ] Add rate limiting

**Files to Create**:
```
/src/middleware/
├── auth.js (Token verification)
├── rbac.js (Role checking)
├── errorHandler.js (Error handling)
└── logger.js (Request logging)
```

---

### **7. Firestore Security Rules**
**Priority**: HIGH

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Update Firestore rules to deny direct client access
- [ ] Allow only authenticated server-side operations
- [ ] Add collection-level access controls
- [ ] Test security rules thoroughly

**Files to Update**:
```
/firestore.rules
```

---

### **8. Environment & Config Security**
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Audit environment variables for security
- [ ] Move sensitive configs to server-side only
- [ ] Add environment validation
- [ ] Update deployment security settings

---

## **Phase 4: Testing & Validation (0.5 days)**

### **9. Security Testing**
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Test all API endpoints with different user roles
- [ ] Verify client-side operations are properly blocked
- [ ] Test unauthorized access scenarios
- [ ] Validate data integrity controls
- [ ] Audit logs review

---

### **10. Performance & Monitoring**

## **📋 Quick Reference - API Endpoints to Create**

```
POST   /api/auth/verify          - Verify user authentication
GET    /api/admin/instructors    - Get all instructors (admin only)
POST   /api/admin/instructors/[id]/approve - Approve instructor
POST   /api/admin/instructors/[id]/reject  - Reject instructor
DELETE /api/admin/instructors/[id]         - Delete instructor

GET    /api/mentors              - Get public mentor data
GET    /api/mentors/[id]         - Get mentor details
GET    /api/clients              - Get mentor's clients
GET    /api/profile              - Get user profile
PUT    /api/profile              - Update user profile
POST   /api/profile/weight       - Add weight record
GET    /api/enrollments          - Get user enrollments
POST   /api/enrollments/[id]/complete - Complete enrollment
```

---

## **⚡ Quick Start Commands**

```bash
# Create API directory structure
mkdir -p src/app/api/{admin/instructors,mentors,clients,profile,enrollments}
mkdir -p src/middleware

# Test security after implementation
npm run test:security  # (create this script)
```

---

## **🔒 Success Criteria**

- [ ] No direct Firestore operations from client-side
- [ ] All sensitive operations go through authenticated APIs
- [ ] Role-based access control enforced server-side
- [ ] Data validation and sanitization implemented
- [ ] Audit logging for all sensitive operations
- [ ] Security rules preventing unauthorized database access
- [ ] All tests passing with proper authorization

---

## **📞 Emergency Contact**
If critical security issues are discovered during implementation, prioritize:
1. Admin dashboard security (payment/financial risk)
2. User data protection (privacy/GDPR risk)
3. Enrollment manipulation (business logic risk)
