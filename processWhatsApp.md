3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor webhook logs
5. Monitor WhatsApp API usage

## Usage Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track:
- **Message delivery rate**: Check webhook delivery status
- **API usage**: Monitor in Meta Business Manager
- **Error rates**: Check Vercel function logs
- **Cost**: Monitor WhatsApp conversations count

### Dashboards to Monitor:
1. **Meta Business Manager** - API usage, billing, errors
2. **Vercel Dashboard** - Function logs, deployment status  
3. **Firebase Console** - Notification storage, errors

## Cost Structure

- **Free Tier**: 1,000 conversations/month
- **Conversation Window**: 24 hours from first message
- **After Free Tier**: ~‚Çπ0.40-0.75 per conversation
